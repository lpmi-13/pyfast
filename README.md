# pyfast

This is a remodeled backend to the original [howfast](https://github.com/lpmi-13/howfast), but redone in flask with scripts
to automatically check for updates and amend a postgres database.

The aim is to leave all the endpoints from the original untouched so that the Angular frontend can hit them in a similar way.
